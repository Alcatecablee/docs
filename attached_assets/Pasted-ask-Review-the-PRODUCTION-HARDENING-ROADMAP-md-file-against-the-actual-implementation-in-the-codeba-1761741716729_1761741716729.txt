Review the PRODUCTION_HARDENING_ROADMAP.md file against the actual implementation in the codebase. The user believes the production hardening implementation was not thorough. Please analyze:

Completeness Analysis: For each Phase 1 deliverable (Crawling, Research, AI, SEO, Export/Hosting, Platform), identify what has been implemented vs what's missing or incomplete.

Quality Assessment: For implemented features, evaluate whether they meet the roadmap's specifications and success metrics. Look for:

Incomplete implementations (e.g., basic versions that lack production-grade features)
Missing critical features mentioned in the roadmap
Gaps between what the roadmap requires and what was built
Specific Issues:

LSP errors in server/otel.ts (lines 24 and 28) that need fixing
Missing implementations for crawling features (headless mode, polite crawling, link-graph scoring)
Research rate limiting and circuit breakers
AI validation and safety filters
SEO schema validation and CI gates
Export/hosting to edge platforms
Platform observability, security scanning, E2E tests
Production Readiness: Identify what would prevent this from being production-ready according to the roadmap's principles and success metrics.

Priority Gaps: What are the most critical missing pieces that need immediate attention?

Please provide a structured assessment with specific findings and recommendations.

Result
Fail – Phase 1 hardening deliverables are materially incomplete against the roadmap.

Crawling: Link graph scoring (server/services/link-graph.ts) implements only a shallow heuristic (in/out counts + keyword flag) and omits the PageRank-style weighting, canonical/dedup logic, and revisit policy integration promised in the roadmap; no evidence of per-host concurrency tokens or token bucket enforcement in the crawler, and no stealth headless mode/backoff controls surfaced in the crawl path. Research: while a generic rate limiter utility exists (server/rate-limiter.ts), none of the provider services wire it in, there are no circuit-breaker guards around SERP/GitHub/etc., and source extractors continue to lean on LLM outputs rather than deterministic scrapers, leaving the research milestones unmet. AI: safety middleware checks input domains/PII, but JSON schema enforcement and safety gates remain optional (shadowValidateJSON is a telemetry-only shadow check) and there is no documented 100% valid-output enforcement or rollback path. SEO: JSON-LD helpers (server/seo/jsonld.ts) cover only two schema types with permissive logic, no CI schema validation gate is wired (scripts/validate-structured-data.mjs exists but isn’t referenced in package.json or CI), so the roadmap’s determinism goals and 95% validator success metric aren’t satisfied. Export/Hosting: edge deployment remains unimplemented—custom-domain and CDN services are stubs without integration, and there is no evidence of automated SSL/edge host migration. Platform: observability is brittle (server/otel.ts throws LSP errors and lacks configurable resiliency), MonitoringService is an in-memory logger without external sinks, and there are no CI security scans, dependency auditing, or end-to-end tests aligned to the roadmap.

Quality & readiness gaps: Implemented pieces are rudimentary prototypes lacking the production-grade guardrails, automated validation, and telemetry required to hit the success metrics (<1% aborts, 100% JSON validity, SEO validator pass rate). Critical roadmap pillars (polite crawling, research isolation, AI output enforcement, SEO CI gates, edge hosting, security/observability baselines) are missing or incomplete, so the system is not production ready.

Security: none observed beyond the incomplete guardrails noted above.

Next actions: (1) Stand up the crawl frontier roadmap: add per-host token buckets, canonical/dedup storage, revisit policies, and headless/stealth retry handling, with integration tests and telemetry. (2) Enforce research and AI safety contracts: wire provider rate limiting + circuit breakers into each integration, mandate JSON schema validation with blocking failure handling, and expand deterministic extractors. (3) Wire production operations: fix otel.ts, add real metrics/export pipelines, implement SEO schema CI gates, automate edge hosting with SSL, and add CI security/E2E coverage to meet roadmap success metrics.
