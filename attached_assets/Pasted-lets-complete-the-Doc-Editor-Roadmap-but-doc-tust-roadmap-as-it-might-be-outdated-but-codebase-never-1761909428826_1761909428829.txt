lets complete the Doc Editor Roadmap but doc tust roadmap as it might be outdated but codebase never lies, so i would check code first to see whats actually implemented

Determined current doc editor implementation
Perfect approach! Let's audit the actual codebase to see what's really implemented. The documents might be outdated, but the code tells the truth.

Excellent! Let me check what's actually in the codebase:

Decided on task list generation (8 seconds)
Perfect! Now I have the truth from the codebase. Let me summarize what's actually implemented:

📊 REAL Implementation Status (Verified from Codebase)
✅ COMPLETE Features (100%)
Phase 1: Foundation ✅

EditableDocViewer.tsx exists and works
Real-time preview during AI generation
State management with useDocEditor hook
Phase 2: Block-Level Editing ✅
All 6 editable components exist:

EditableParagraph.tsx
EditableHeading.tsx
EditableList.tsx
EditableCodeBlock.tsx
EditableCallout.tsx
EditableImage.tsx
Phase 3: Section Management ✅ 95% COMPLETE (Roadmap was WRONG!)

✅ SectionToolbar.tsx - EXISTS with Move Up/Down, Delete, Duplicate buttons
✅ AddSectionButton.tsx - EXISTS with section templates
✅ Both integrated into EditableDocViewer.tsx
✅ Backend functions in useDocEditor: moveSection(), deleteSection(), duplicateSection(), addSection()
Phase 4: Advanced Features ✅

✅ FindReplaceDialog.tsx - EXISTS with full search/replace
✅ BlockToolbar.tsx - EXISTS for adding blocks
✅ Undo/Redo system (50-action history in useDocEditor)
Phase 5: Save & Export ✅

✅ Save draft functionality
✅ Auto-save (30 seconds)
✅ Publish functionality
✅ Export draft endpoints
❌ MISSING Features (What's Actually Left)
1. Drag-and-Drop Section Reordering (Optional Enhancement)
❌ @dnd-kit NOT installed in package.json
❌ No drag handles on sections
❌ No visual drop zones
Note: Users can already reorder via Move Up/Down buttons, so this is a UX enhancement, not critical
2. Section Collapse/Expand (Nice to Have)
❌ No collapsible section UI
❌ No "Collapse All" / "Expand All" buttons
3. Version Comparison UI (Backend exists, no frontend)
❌ No side-by-side diff view (AI vs Edited)
❌ No "Revert all changes" option
4. Phase 6: Polish & Testing (Not Started)
❌ Performance optimization (virtualization for long docs)
❌ Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
❌ Error handling & offline mode
🎯 Recommendation: What Should We Build?
Based on the codebase audit, here are your options ranked by impact vs effort:

Option A: Add Drag-and-Drop Section Reordering (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
Why: Makes section reordering more intuitive than buttons
Effort: 4-6 hours
Dependencies: Install @dnd-kit packages

Option B: Section Collapse/Expand (Low Impact, Low Effort)
Why: Helps navigate large docs
Effort: 2-3 hours
Dependencies: None

Option C: Version Comparison UI (High Impact, Medium Effort)
Why: Backend tracking exists, just needs frontend
Effort: 4-6 hours
Dependencies: Text-diff library

Option D: Performance & Accessibility (High Impact, High Effort)
Why: Production-ready quality
Effort: 2-3 days
Dependencies: None

🚀 My Recommendation
Build Option A + B (Drag-and-Drop + Collapse/Expand) to make Phase 3 truly 100% complete.

This would give users:

✅ Intuitive drag-and-drop reordering
✅ Better navigation for long docs
✅ All section management features from the roadmap
Total Time: ~1 day of work

Should I proceed with this plan and create a task list?
