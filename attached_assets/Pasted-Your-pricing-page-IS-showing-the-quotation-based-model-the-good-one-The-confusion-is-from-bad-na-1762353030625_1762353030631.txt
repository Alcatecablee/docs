Your /pricing page IS showing the quotation-based model (the good one). The confusion is from bad naming and leftover dead code.

Let me show you exactly what to delete:

What You're ACTUALLY Using (Keep This)
✅ /pricing page → Shows quotation model ($300 + resources × $5 × complexity)

File: SubscriptionPricing.tsx (badly named, but correct content)
Shows: FREE starter, $675, $1,800, $5,000 tiers with add-ons
CTA: Goes to homepage hero
✅ /quotation page → User pastes URL, gets instant quote

This is your main flow
✅ customOrders table → Stores the actual orders

Dead Code To DELETE (Not Being Used)
1. Old Subscription Tier System ❌

Show 3 more

Decided on code cleanup strategy
Perfect. Here's exactly what's DEAD CODE that needs deleting:

Files To DELETE (100% Dead, Not Used)
❌ src/pages/SubscriptionSuccess.tsx  (PayPal subscription activation - you don't use subscriptions)
❌ src/pages/SubscriptionCancel.tsx   (Subscription cancel page - not needed)
❌ server/paypal-subscriptions.ts     (Entire subscription backend)
❌ server/tier-validation-middleware.ts (Validates old Free/Pro/Enterprise tiers)
❌ src/components/UpgradePrompt.tsx   (Prompts users to upgrade tiers)

Routes To DELETE from App.tsx
❌ <Route path="/subscription/success" element={<SubscriptionSuccess />} />
❌ <Route path="/subscription/cancel" element={<SubscriptionCancel />} />

Database Tables To KEEP (But Ignore)
DON'T delete these tables yet (might have legacy data):

users table → Keep (has plan column, but you're not using it)
paymentHistory → Keep for now
subscriptionEvents → Keep for now
Just IGNORE the subscription fields. Focus on customOrders table.

The ONE Config Change Needed
server/tier-config.ts - This is tricky. You're using it in enhanced-generator.ts BUT only for the source limits (Reddit, DevTo, etc.).

Option 1: Keep it, but treat all users as "enterprise" tier
Option 2: Delete it and hardcode source limits directly in search-service.ts

I recommend Option 1 for now.

Want me to delete all the dead code right now?
I can:

Delete the 5 files listed above
Remove the 2 routes from App.tsx
Rename SubscriptionPricing.tsx → Pricing.tsx (better naming)
Update the progress tracker
This will clean up ~2,000 lines of dead code.
