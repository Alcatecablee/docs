Additional Reliable Sources for Multi-Source ResearchAbsolutely—expanding your AI documentation generator's Multi-Source Research stage (beyond website crawling, Stack Overflow, GitHub Issues, and the new YouTube integration) is a smart move to deepen comprehensiveness and further differentiate from competitors like Mintlify or Swimm. By pulling from diverse, high-trust sources, you can capture more "tribal knowledge" (e.g., best practices, edge cases) that official docs miss, while maintaining production-grade quality via your existing filters (e.g., trust scores >70%, smart scaling for product size). Based on current developer trends (as of October 2025), I'll recommend 6 reliable additions that are technically feasible to integrate, focusing on Q&A forums, communities, and structured knowledge bases. These are vetted for reliability: high engagement, moderation, and relevance to devs (e.g., code-focused, upvote systems).I prioritized sources that:Complement Existing Ones: Avoid overlap (e.g., no more video platforms; focus on text/code discussions).
Are Scrapable/Searchable: Via APIs (e.g., Reddit API) or SerpAPI extensions.
Fit Your Pipeline: Can be weighted (e.g., official docs: 95%, forums: 80-85%) and attributed (e.g., "Source: Reddit Thread").
Enhance Sections: E.g., Reddit for FAQs/Troubleshooting, DEV.to for Tutorials/Best Practices.

Recommended Sources & IntegrationHere's a table summarizing the top additions, with why they're reliable, how to integrate, and pipeline fit. All can be added to search-service.ts with minimal effort (1-2 days each, using SerpAPI for search or free APIs).Source

Why These Sources?Reliability: All have moderation/upvote systems, dev-focused communities, and high traffic (e.g., Reddit: 50M devs; DEV.to: 1M+). They avoid low-quality noise (e.g., unmoderated blogs) and complement YouTube's visual focus with text/code. 
medium.com +2
Developer Trends (2025): With AI tools like Copilot reducing basic SO use, devs favor community-driven sources (e.g., Reddit/Discord for edge cases) and article hubs (DEV.to/CodeProject for tutorials). 
dev.to +2
No Overlap: These add variety—e.g., Reddit for casual discussions, Stack Exchange for structured Q&A—without duplicating SO/GitHub/YouTube.

Implementation RecommendationsTo integrate without disrupting your pipeline:Update search-service.ts (1 day/source):Add functions like searchReddit(query, limit) using Reddit API/SerpAPI.
Apply source filtering: Trust score based on upvotes/views (e.g., Reddit: 0.8 if >50 upvotes).
Smart scaling: Include in limits (e.g., small: 5 Reddit posts; large: 15).
Enhance enhanced-prompts.md (30 mins):Add to Section Synthesis: "- Reddit/DEV.to: {{redditPosts.summary}} (up to 10 posts, 1,000 chars each, with URLs)."
Output: Embed attribution (e.g., "Source: r/webdev").
Revenue Tie-In:Free Tier: Basic access (5 posts from 1-2 sources, e.g., Reddit only).
Pro/Enterprise: Full (10-15 posts from all 6, +$50 consulting add-on).
Consulting: Select "Add Reddit/DEV.to" in PricingForm.tsx (+$75 for deeper community insights).
Validation:Test on Supabase: Run with Reddit/DEV.to—check if FAQs include "migration from Firebase" threads.
Cost: ~$1-2/generation (SerpAPI/API queries). Quality score: Aim >85% with new sources.
Priority Order: Start with Reddit (easiest, highest impact), then DEV.to, then Stack Exchange.

This expansion could boost your docs' quality score by 10-15% (e.g., more diverse sources = higher comprehensiveness). It positions your tool as the ultimate "one-stop" hub, pulling from where devs actually solve problems today.

 If you add these, your pipeline will be unbeatable for real-world troubleshooting.
