Excellent! I've successfully built and tested the Custom Pricing & PayPal Integration for your consulting services. Here's what's now live on your platform:

âœ… What I Built
1. Dynamic Pricing Calculator
A sophisticated pricing system that calculates custom quotes based on:

Documentation size: 8-12 sections ($500), 13-20 sections ($750), or 20+ sections ($1,000)
Research depth: Basic, Standard (+20%), or Deep (+50%)
Delivery speed: Standard 3 days (free), Rush 24 hours (+30%), or Same-day 12 hours (+100%)
Export formats: PDF ($50), DOCX ($75), HTML ($25), Markdown ($25), JSON ($10), Subdomain ($150)
Branding level: Basic (included) or Advanced (+$200)
Custom requirements: AI analyzes text to detect complexity (low/medium/high) and adjusts pricing
Multi-currency: USD and South African Rand (ZAR) with automatic conversion
2. PayPal Integration
Complete payment processing system:

âœ… Creates orders with embedded metadata
âœ… Redirects to PayPal checkout
âœ… Captures payment after approval
âœ… Security: Server-side price validation prevents tampering (rejects if price differs by >$0.50)
âœ… Success and cancel handlers
3. Automated Documentation Generation
After payment is captured:

âœ… Automatically triggers your enhanced AI documentation pipeline
âœ… Generates docs with the purchased specifications
âœ… Sends confirmation to customer's PayPal email
âœ… Async processing doesn't block payment response
4. Professional UI

Clean cyan-blue theme matching your brand
