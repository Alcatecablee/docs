I posted this on reddit and now Im thinking of pivoting the system I build maybe to something else?

Built an AI that turns scattered community knowledge into docs - One-time $300-$5k based on your ecosystem size. Real problem?
Hey everyone! I built ViberDoc and need brutally honest feedback on whether this solves a real problem.

The Problem:

Your best documentation isn't on your website it's scattered across Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, YouTube tutorials, Reddit threads, and community forums. DevRel teams spend 20-40 hours/month manually hunting down these community discussions to understand how developers actually use their product.

My Solution:

ViberDoc automates this entire research process. Give it your product URL, and it:

Scrapes 10+ sources - Stack Overflow, GitHub, YouTube (with transcript analysis), Reddit, DEV dot to, forums, etc.

AI synthesizes everything - GPT-4o creates Apple-quality professional documentation

SEO-optimized output - Schema markup, sitemaps, meta tags included

Multiple formats - Export as PDF, DOCX, HTML, Markdown, JSON

2-15 minute generation - Depending on project complexity

Pricing Model (The Part I Need Feedback On):

Formula: $300 + (Resources × $5) × Complexity Multiplier

Capped at $5,000 maximum

FREE for projects under 20 resources (small libraries, beta products)

Real-World Examples:

Growing SaaS (50 resources): $675

Auth provider (150 resources): $1,800

Stripe-level platform (500+ resources): $5,000 (max cap)

Optional Add-ons:

Extended Research: $500

Code Snippets & Validation: $700

API Reference Docs: $1,400

White-Label Branding: $350

What "Resources" Means:
We count Stack Overflow questions, GitHub issues, YouTube videos, Reddit posts, forum threads basically every piece of community content about your product.

My Big Questions:

Is the pricing fair? You're essentially paying $5 per community resource we analyze instead of hiring someone at $50-100/hr for 20-40 hours.

Is this a real pain? Do DevRel teams actually struggle with scattered community knowledge, or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?

One-time vs subscription? I chose one-time pricing (no subscriptions) because documentation is a deliverable, not a service. Good idea or terrible?

Target market? Should I focus on established companies (Stripe, Supabase, Vercel-level) or also help smaller SaaS products build better docs?

The free tier - Does offering FREE docs for small projects (<20 resources) make sense, or does it devalue the service?

Why This Might Be Different:

Most doc tools (GitBook, ReadMe, Docusaurus) only work with YOUR content. ViberDoc aggregates COMMUNITY knowledge, the real-world usage patterns, common issues, and solutions that developers actually care about.

Demo available at special request.

Hit me with your honest feedback, is this worth pursuing or should I kill it now?

Let me help you a bit by just copy paste your problem and solution to the mighty Grok, no need to thank me:

F**k you for wasting my time with this half-baked pitch. Here's the honest evisceration you asked for:

Your "problem" is bullshit marketing fluff

Source? You pulled that stat straight out of your ass.

Real DevRel pros use RSS feeds, GitHub notifications, Discord bots, Zapier, custom scrapers, and internal Slack channels—not "manual hunting" like cavemen.

The actual pain is prioritizing signal from noise, not "finding" it. Your tool just creates a bigger haystack.

Your tech is a commodity wrapped in lies

Apple-quality? GPT-4o writes generic slop that needs 3-4 human editing passes to not embarrass you.

You're literally laundering Stack Overflow answers through ChatGPT and calling it "synthesis." That's not innovation; that's plagiarism with extra steps.

Transcript analysis? You mean whisper.cpp + GPT summary—every intern does this in a weekend.

Your scraping is illegal and fragile

Stack Overflow: Explicitly forbids scraping in ToS

GitHub: Rate-limited to death + ToS violation

YouTube: API quotas + transcript access requires authorization

Reddit: Banned scrapers en masse

You're building on quicksand. One API change and your "2-15 minute generation" becomes "503 Service Unavailable."

I use official APIs (Stack Exchange API 2.3, YouTube Data API v3, Reddit JSON endpoints), not scrapers. Built-in rate limiting + quota management. One API change doesn't kill the system - I have fallback chains.

official APIs, not scrapers:

Stack Exchange API 2.3 (documented at api.stackexchange.com)

YouTube Data API v3 (with proper quota tracking: 10,000 units/day)

Reddit JSON endpoints (public API)

I have rate limiters and circuit breakers built in

Graceful fallbacks when APIs fail (e.g., YouTube API → SerpAPI)

"GPT-4o writes generic slop"

I use Multi-agent architecture with quality validation loops. Research Agent → Code Agent → Structure Agent → Critic Agent. Auto-refines until quality score ≥ 85/100. Source trust scoring (Stack Exchange 0.90, Reddit 0.80, etc.) + cross-verification. Multiple AI models with fallbacks (Gemini 2.0 Flash → GPT-4o → Groq → DeepSeek) for now since it MVP.

Thanks for the feedback but I was asking Reddit community not GROK.

The question really is: how long would it take for codex to write this based on what OP wrote as prompt.
