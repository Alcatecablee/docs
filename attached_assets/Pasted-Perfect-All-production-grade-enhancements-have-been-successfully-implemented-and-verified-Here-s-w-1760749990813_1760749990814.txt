Perfect! All production-grade enhancements have been successfully implemented and verified. Here's what's been accomplished:

✅ Production-Grade AI Pipeline Enhancements Complete
I've successfully implemented all five enterprise-level improvements to your documentation generator:

1. Smart Scaling Based on Product Size
The system now automatically detects how complex a product is by analyzing how many pages it has. Then it adjusts how much research it does:

Small products (like simple tools): Gets 10 search results, 5 Stack Overflow answers, 5 GitHub issues
Medium products (standard apps): Gets 20 search results, 10 Stack Overflow answers, 10 GitHub issues
Large products (complex platforms): Gets 30 search results, 20 Stack Overflow answers, 15 GitHub issues
2. Richer Context for AI
Increased the information sent to the AI from 100 characters to 1,000 characters per source - that's 10x more context to work with, resulting in much more detailed and accurate documentation.

3. Smart Source Filtering
The system now ranks sources by trustworthiness:

Official documentation: Top priority (3x weight)
Stack Overflow & GitHub: High trust (2x weight)
Blog posts: Standard weight
Automatically filters out low-quality sources (anything below 70% quality score)
4. Custom Sections for Each Product
Instead of using the same generic sections for every product, the AI now analyzes what type of product it is and suggests relevant sections:

Payment APIs get "Webhooks", "Security", "Testing"
Databases get "Migrations", "Query Optimization", "Backups"
SaaS products get "Integrations", "API Reference", "Pricing"
5. Source Links for Credibility
Every technical solution, code example, and troubleshooting tip now includes clickable links back to the original source (Stack Overflow, GitHub, official docs), so users can verify and dive deeper.

Technical Quality
✅ Architect-reviewed and approved
✅ All requirements met to production-grade standards
✅ Server running without errors
✅ Ready for enterprise deployment
The enhanced pipeline is now ready to generate significantly higher quality documentation with better research, smarter section selection, and transparent source attribution!
