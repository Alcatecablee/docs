Great call to shift to a dynamic quotation page for Viberdoc—this leverages your app’s superpower of pulling in scattered external data and makes it a tailored, high-value proposition for users. Redirecting users to a quotation page after pasting a URL is a slick UX move, and automating the complexity analysis to generate a custom quote eliminates the rigidity of fixed pricing. Let’s refine this system, focusing on how the quote looks, what add-ons to offer, and how they impact pricing and scope. Your recent thoughts on a DevRel pivot align perfectly here—let’s tailor it for teams dealing with complex, community-rich products.Proposed Quotation System DesignStep 1: URL Analysis & Auto-Complexity ScoringWhen a user pastes a URL (e.g., stripe.com/docs), Viberdoc analyzes:Community Footprint Metrics:Stack Overflow questions (API calls to SO via SerpAPI—e.g., 1,200+ for Stripe).
GitHub mentions/issues (e.g., 340 discussions via GitHub API).
YouTube tutorials (e.g., 50+ via YouTube Data API).
Reddit threads (e.g., 20+ via Pushshift API).
DEV.to articles (e.g., 15+ via DEV API).
Site Complexity:Pages crawled (e.g., 87 pages for Stripe).
Subdomain depth (e.g., docs.stripe.com vs. main site).
Scoring:Low (0-30 resources): 1.0x multiplier.
Medium (31-100 resources): 1.5x multiplier.
High (101+ resources): 2.0x multiplier.
Base Formula:
Base Price = ($200 × Resource Count / 10) × Complexity Multiplier + $300 minimum.
Example: Stripe (1,200 resources, High) = ($200 × 120) × 2 + $300 = $48,300 (capped at $3,000 for sanity—adjust based on market).

Step 2: Default Package (Always Included)What’s Included:Crawl up to 50 pages + sitemap parsing.
Top 50 Stack Overflow questions + 20 GitHub issues.
10 Reddit threads + 5 DEV.to articles.
Basic doc structure (FAQs, Getting Started, Troubleshooting).
1 export format (PDF or Markdown).
15-day support via email.
Estimated Cost: $300-$3,000 based on complexity (e.g., Stripe = $3,000 base).

Step 3: Add-Ons (Customizable Checkboxes)Here’s a refined set of add-ons, balancing flexibility and profitability.

Best for: API-first (e.g., Twilio).  
Impact: +15-25 sections, +3-5 days.
Branding & Hosting (+$150-$400)  Custom themes, logo integration, subdomain hosting.  
Best for: Enterprise (e.g., Yoco).  
Impact: +5% scope, +1 day.
Quarterly Updates (+$150/quarter)  Re-run research, update docs every 3 months.  
Best for: Evolving products (e.g., Next.js).  
Impact: Ongoing contract, +1 day initial setup.
Step 4: Quote Preview DesignHere’s a clean, user-friendly layout:
