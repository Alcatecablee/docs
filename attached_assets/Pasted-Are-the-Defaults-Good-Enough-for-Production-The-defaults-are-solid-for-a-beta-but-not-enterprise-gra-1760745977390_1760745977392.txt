Are the Defaults Good Enough for Production?The defaults are solid for a beta but not enterprise-grade for a production system aiming to outshine competitors like Mintlify or ReadMe.io. Here’s why:Strengths:Quality Filters: Limiting SO answers to 5 questions with 3 answers (>5 votes) and GitHub to 5 issues ensures relevance and avoids noise.
Token Optimization: Truncating inputs (100 chars for SO/GitHub, 5,000 chars per page) keeps OpenAI costs manageable and fits within GPT-4’s context window.
Balanced Scope: 10 search results + 5 SO questions + 5 GitHub issues is enough to capture community insights without overwhelming the AI.
Smart Deduplication: Filtering duplicates and low-quality sources (per search-service.ts) ensures clean inputs.

Weaknesses:Low Source Volume: Only 5 SO questions and 5 GitHub issues might miss critical edge cases (e.g., obscure Supabase RLS bugs discussed in a 6th issue). Competitors like Swimm pull broader datasets for deeper insights.
Over-Truncation: Cutting SO answers and GitHub issues to 100 chars for AI input risks losing nuance (e.g., a complex retry logic explanation). GPT-4 can handle ~32K tokens—why not use more?
Static Limits: Fixed caps (e.g., 10 search results) don’t adapt to complex products (Stripe vs. a small SaaS). Dynamic scaling would be more robust.
No Source Weighting: All sources (SO, GitHub, blogs) are treated equally, but official docs or high-upvote SO answers should carry more weight.

Recommendations to Level Up for Production (OpenAI-Powered)To make your Multi-Source Research stage enterprise-ready and maximize OpenAI’s capabilities, tweak the defaults and pipeline for deeper synthesis and robustness. These changes assume you’re using GPT-4o (or similar) with no budget limits, focusing on production-level polish.Increase Source Volume with Dynamic Scaling:Why: 5 SO questions + 5 GitHub issues is too restrictive for complex products like Stripe. You risk missing critical community solutions.
Fix: Scale based on product complexity (e.g., detected via crawled page count or GitHub repo size).typescript

// server/search-service.ts
const sourceLimits = {
  small: { soQuestions: 5, githubIssues: 5, searchResults: 10 },
  medium: { soQuestions: 10, githubIssues: 10, searchResults: 15 },
  large: { soQuestions: 20, githubIssues: 15, searchResults: 20 }
};
const productSize = estimateComplexity(crawledPages, githubRepoStats);
const limits = sourceLimits[productSize];
const soResults = await searchStackOverflow(query, limits.soQuestions);
Impact: Covers edge cases for big players (e.g., Stripe’s webhook quirks) without bloating simple SaaS docs. GPT-4o’s 128K tokens can handle 20 SO questions easily.
Loosen Truncation for Richer Inputs:Why: Truncating SO answers and GitHub issues to 100 chars loses critical details (e.g., a full retry loop explanation). GPT-4o can process ~10,000 words per call.
Fix: Increase to 1,000 chars per answer/issue, with semantic chunking:typescript

// server/enhanced-generator.ts
const chunkedSources = sources.map(s => ({
  content: s.content.slice(0, 1000), // Was 100
  summary: summarize(s.content, 100) // For quick AI reference
}));
const aiInput = chunkedSources.concat(crawledPages.slice(0, 10)); // Up from 5 pages
Impact: Deeper synthesis (e.g., catches nuanced Supabase auth patterns). OpenAI’s reasoning can merge longer inputs into concise outputs.
Weight Sources by Trust:Why: Treating SO, GitHub, and random blogs equally risks bad data (e.g., outdated blog vs. official docs). Competitors like Mintlify prioritize trusted sources.
Fix: Add a trust score to each source:typescript

// server/search-service.ts
const trustScores = {
  officialDocs: 0.95,
  stackOverflow: s => Math.min(0.9, 0.5 + (s.upvotes / 100)),
  githubIssue: i => i.isClosed ? 0.85 : 0.7,
  blog: b => b.domainAuthority > 50 ? 0.6 : 0.4
};
const weightedSources = sources.map(s => ({
  ...s,
  weight: trustScores[s.type](s)
})).filter(s => s.weight > 0.5);
Impact: Official docs and high-upvote SO answers dominate, ensuring accuracy. Blogs only supplement if high-quality (e.g., Ray Wenderlich vs. random Medium post).
Dynamic Section Generation:Why: Fixed 8-10 sections (e.g., Troubleshooting, FAQ) might not fit all products. Vercel needs heavy "Deployment" focus; Supabase needs "Database Migrations."
Fix: Use OpenAI to infer needed sections from source data:typescript

// server/enhanced-generator.ts
const sectionPrompt = `
  Analyze ${sources.length} sources and ${crawledPages.length} pages.
  Suggest 8-12 sections tailored to the product (e.g., "Database Migrations" for Supabase).
  Return: { sections: string[], rationale: string }
`;
const { sections } = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  prompt: sectionPrompt,
  max_tokens: 500
});
Impact: Docs feel custom-built (e.g., Stripe gets “Webhooks” section). This beats competitors’ static templates.
Add Source Attribution for Trust:Why: Users want to verify where solutions come from (e.g., SO vs. official docs). Your defaults don’t emphasize this in the output.
Fix: Embed clickable source links in every section:markdown

## Troubleshooting Webhooks (Stripe)
**Issue**: Webhook retries fail under load.
**Solution**: Increase retry delay to 5s. Example:
```javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => { /* Retry logic */ });

Sources: Stripe Docs, SO #789, GitHub #123
Impact: Builds trust and lets users dig deeper, unlike competitors’ opaque outputs.
