I’d like users to be redirected to a quotation page when they paste a link. On that page, the system should automatically analyze the URL’s complexity (for example, by checking how many YouTube tutorials, forum questions, or related resources exist about it). Based on that analysis, it should generate a quote automatically — removing the need for fixed pricing.The quote should include a default package, and users can optionally tick add-ons to expand or customize their quote. I’m still refining how the quote will look, what each add-on will include, and how those add-ons will affect pricing and project scope. I need hel/suggestions on that5 minutes agoPondered dynamic quotation system (9 seconds)
This is a brilliant strategic shift! Moving from fixed subscriptions to dynamic project-based quotations aligns perfectly with the DevRel pivot. Let me help you design this quotation system. Strategic Shift: Subscription → Custom Quotations
Why This Works for DevRel Teams
DevRel teams have budgets for projects, not recurring SaaS subscriptions
Each product has unique complexity (Stripe has 1000+ Stack Overflow questions, a new startup has 10)
One-time comprehensive documentation is more valuable than monthly generations
Aligns with how companies buy: project quotes > subscriptions
 Proposed Quotation System
Step 1: URL Analysis (Auto-Complexity Scoring)
When a user pastes their URL, analyze:Community Footprint Metrics:Stack Overflow questions (0-10 = $500 base, 11-100 = $1,500, 100+ = $3,000+)
GitHub repositories/issues mentioning the product
YouTube tutorial count
Reddit discussions
DEV.to articles
Documentation pages discovered
Complexity Multiplier:Simple product (5-10 pages) = 1.0x
Medium product (11-50 pages) = 1.5x
Complex product (50+ pages) = 2.0x
Base Quote Formula:Base Price = (Community Footprint Score × Complexity Multiplier) + $500 minimum
Step 2: Package Structure

 Questions for You
Pricing Range: What's your target range? ($500-$5,000? $1,000-$10,000?)
Delivery Time: Should complex quotes have longer delivery (3 days vs 10 days)?
Payment: Upfront 100%? Or 50% deposit + 50% on delivery?
Revisions: Include 1-2 revision rounds in base package?
Custom Quotes: Should users be able to request calls for $10K+ enterprise deals?
Great call to shift to a dynamic quotation page for Viberdoc—this leverages your app’s superpower of pulling in scattered external data and makes it a tailored, high-value proposition for users. Redirecting users to a quotation page after pasting a URL is a slick UX move, and automating the complexity analysis to generate a custom quote eliminates the rigidity of fixed pricing. Let’s refine this system, focusing on how the quote looks, what add-ons to offer, and how they impact pricing and scope. Your recent thoughts on a DevRel pivot align perfectly here—let’s tailor it for teams dealing with complex, community-rich products.Proposed Quotation System DesignStep 1: URL Analysis & Auto-Complexity ScoringWhen a user pastes a URL (e.g., stripe.com/docs), Viberdoc analyzes:Community Footprint Metrics:Stack Overflow questions (API calls to SO via SerpAPI—e.g., 1,200+ for Stripe).
GitHub mentions/issues (e.g., 340 discussions via GitHub API).
YouTube tutorials (e.g., 50+ via YouTube Data API).
Reddit threads (e.g., 20+ via Pushshift API).
DEV.to articles (e.g., 15+ via DEV API).
Site Complexity:Pages crawled (e.g., 87 pages for Stripe).
Subdomain depth (e.g., docs.stripe.com vs. main site).
Scoring:Low (0-30 resources): 1.0x multiplier.
Medium (31-100 resources): 1.5x multiplier.
High (101+ resources): 2.0x multiplier.
Base Formula:
Base Price = ($200 × Resource Count / 10) × Complexity Multiplier + $300 minimum.
Example: Stripe (1,200 resources, High) = ($200 × 120) × 2 + $300 = $48,300 (capped at $3,000 for sanity—adjust based on market).

Step 2: Default Package (Always Included)What’s Included:Crawl up to 50 pages + sitemap parsing.
Top 50 Stack Overflow questions + 20 GitHub issues.
10 Reddit threads + 5 DEV.to articles.
Basic doc structure (FAQs, Getting Started, Troubleshooting).
1 export format (PDF or Markdown).
15-day support via email.
Estimated Cost: $300-$3,000 based on complexity (e.g., Stripe = $3,000 base).

Step 3: Add-Ons (Customizable Checkboxes)Here’s a refined set of add-ons, balancing flexibility and profitability. Pricing scales with complexity—low/medium/high tiers reflect resource depth.Extended Research (+$200-$600)  Deep dive into 20-50 YouTube tutorials, 100+ SO questions, Quora/Discord forums.

Test: Run on stripe.com, taxfy.co.za—verify quotes make sense.

This setup maximizes your external-data superpower for big players. Want to mock up the /quote component or test a sample quote for Taxfy? 
so tell em why does the delivery time take long if the whole process is automated and is done by AI, why days instead of minute/hours. maybe take me through the whole process, lets say I get this user (TOTAL: $3,000
With selected add-ons: $7,800 (e.g., all checked)
[Adjust Add-Ons] [Proceed to PayPal]) what happens next behind the scens and what are my actions/duties to comple order or business with user?
Great question! It’s totally valid to wonder why delivery takes days when the process is AI-driven and seems fast on the surface. Let’s dive into why this happens, walk through the entire process for your user with a $3,000 base quote (scaling to $7,800 with all add-ons), and outline your actions/duties to complete the order. This will give you clarity on the behind-the-scenes workflow and how to manage it as a solo founder running Viberdoc at 06:18 AM SAST on Saturday, October 25, 2025.Why Delivery Takes Days, Not Minutes/HoursEven with AI automation, the delivery timeline stretches to days due to several real-world factors—none of which undermine Viberdoc’s value but are critical to manage user expectations:Data Volume & Processing:Why: Analyzing 50+ pages, 1,200+ Stack Overflow posts, 340 GitHub issues, 50+ YouTube videos, and 20 Reddit threads (e.g., for stripe.com/docs) involves massive data. GPT-4o can process ~100K tokens/minute, but fetching, scoring, and synthesizing this volume takes time—especially with external API rate limits (e.g., YouTube Data API caps at 10K units/day).
Time: Initial crawl (30-60 mins), research aggregation (1-2 hours), synthesis (1-2 hours) = ~3-5 hours of compute time.
Quality Assurance:Why: Automated outputs need human-like validation to catch AI hallucinations (e.g., 5% error rate on technical terms) or source inaccuracies. Scoring relevance/authority and validating citations (e.g., linking to SO posts) adds a review layer.
Time: Manual spot-check or AI double-check (30 mins-1 hour), depending on add-ons.
Add-On Complexity:Why: Add-ons like Code Snippets ($800) require testing 200 samples, Migration Guides ($1,000) need competitor analysis, and API Reference ($1,500) demands endpoint mapping. These are compute-intensive and need refinement.
Time: +1-3 days per add-on, as AI iterates and you (or a script) verify.
Queue Management:Why: With BullMQ handling jobs, high-priority orders (e.g., same-day) jump ahead, pushing standard orders (5-7 days) back. Solo operation means one server—queue depth matters.
Time: 1-3 days wait time for non-rush orders.
Export & Delivery:Why: Generating multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML) and uploading to S3/Supabase, plus email notifications, adds a final step. Branding/custom hosting (e.g., docs.stripe.viberdoc.com) requires DNS propagation (up to 24 hours).
Time: 1-2 hours, but hosting delays extend it.
Total: Base (3-5 hours compute + 1-2 days queue) = 3-7 days. Add-ons push it to 5-10 days. Minutes/hours are feasible for simple jobs (e.g., 10 pages, no add-ons), but complexity justifies days—users pay for depth, not speed.Walkthrough: User with $3,000 → $7,800 Order (stripe.com/docs)Let’s say a user pastes stripe.com/docs, gets a $3,000 base quote, checks all add-ons ($7,800 total), and hits "Proceed to PayPal" at 06:30 AM SAST today.Behind-the-Scenes ProcessPayment Initiation (06:30 AM - 06:35 AM):User redirected to /quote → PayPal approves $7,800.

User downloads from /dashboard.
Total Time: ~9 hours compute + 24-48 hours queue/DNS = 2-3 days (rush) or 5-7 days (standard).Your Actions/DutiesAs the solo founder, here’s your role:Monitor Queue (Daily, 15 mins):Check BullMQ dashboard (e.g., via Redis UI) for stuck jobs. Restart if needed.
Quality Review (30-60 mins/order):Spot-check 5% of output (e.g., 4/80 sections for Stripe). Fix AI errors (e.g., wrong code) manually or with GPT-4o.
Customer Communication (15 mins):Reply to support emails (e.g., “Stripe doc in progress, 80% complete”).
Send completion email (automated but verify).
Payment Handling (5 mins):Confirm PayPal payout ($7,800 - 5.4% fee = ~$7,378 net). Log in paymentHistory.
Upsell (Optional, 10 mins):Email: “Love your Stripe docs? Quarterly updates for $150—interested?”
Effort: ~1-2 hours/order. For 5 orders/week ($38,900 revenue), that’s 5-10 hours—sustainable solo.Managing Long Delivery TimesSet Expectations: On the quote page, note: “AI-powered, but depth takes 5-7 days. Rush (+50%) for 2-3 days.”
Transparency: Show progress tracker (e.g., “Research: 75%” in /dashboard).
Optimize: Batch simple jobs for same-day delivery, prioritize rush orders.
