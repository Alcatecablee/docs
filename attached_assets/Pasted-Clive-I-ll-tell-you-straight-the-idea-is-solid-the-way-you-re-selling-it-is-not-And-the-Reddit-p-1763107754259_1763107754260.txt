Clive, I’ll tell you straight: the idea is solid, the way you're selling it is not.
And the Reddit pivot question? Yeah—you should pivot, but not away from the core tech. You should pivot away from “AI documentation generator” because that space is saturated, misunderstood, and full of haters who think anything AI + docs = generic crap.

Here’s the real picture:

🔥 WHAT YOU ACTUALLY BUILT

Not a doc generator.

You built a:

“Community Intelligence Engine”

An automated system that harvests public knowledge from 10+ sources, correlates it, ranks it by trust, and synthesizes it into structured insights.

That is not documentation.
That is developer intelligence.

DevRel teams, product teams, founders, technical writers—they actually need insights, not 40-page PDF docs.

Docs are the output format.
Your actual product is the knowledge graph + synthesis pipeline.

That’s the pivot.

🔥 YOUR REAL VALUE PROP (the pivot)

Right now, your framing makes people think:

“Just another doc generator with GPT slapped on.”

But what you're actually enabling is:

A unified window into how your product is used, misunderstood, and broken in the wild.

This is what companies like Stripe, Supabase, Firebase, Twilio spend millions on:

What are developers struggling with?

What are the repeated bugs?

What are the top misconceptions?

Where are the undocumented patterns?

What integrations fail the most?

What is trending in real time?

What do people complain about on GitHub?

What do tutorial creators all say differently?

That is DevRel gold.

Documentation is only one of the possible formats.
You're sitting on a much bigger product.

🔥 SHOULD YOU PIVOT?

Yes. Pivot the framing, not the tech.

Move from:

❌ “AI that turns scattered community knowledge into documentation”

To:

✅ “AI that reveals your product’s entire community knowledge graph: problems, insights, usage patterns, repeated issues, hidden workflows.”

Documentation becomes one export option among many.

🔥 WHAT TO BUILD INSTEAD (using the same engine)

Here are killer directions that match your pipeline and have REAL demand:

1️⃣ DevRel Intelligence Dashboard

Visualize:

Top developer pain points

Trends in issues/questions

Most referenced features

Common integration failures

Confusion hotspots

Missing docs (based on detected patterns)

Support load predictions

Companies would pay $300–$20k/year for this. Easy.

2️⃣ “Community Heatmap”

Every product has dark corners. You show them where:

devs struggle

devs hack around limitations

devs misunderstand design patterns

devs repeatedly ask the same thing

This is gold for product teams.

3️⃣ “Documentation Gap Finder”

You show them exactly what their docs should contain but don’t.

This sells like crazy.

4️⃣ “Knowledge Consolidation as a Service”

Like you already pitched—but positioned as:

“We’ll extract everything your community knows and reorganize it into structured, verified knowledge.”

Not “we generate docs”, but:

“We unify your entire knowledge ecosystem.”

Way more premium.
Way less resistance.
Way more enterprise-friendly.

🔥 WHAT TO DROP IMMEDIATELY

Drop these terms permanently:

“GPT-4o creates Apple-quality documentation” (instant red flag)

“AI documentation” (people assume low effort)

“Scrape multiplier pricing” (feels scammy—even if not)

Replace with language around:

insight extraction

community intelligence

knowledge consolidation

developer understanding

product transparency

🔥 WHAT TO KEEP

Your core engine is valuable AF:

multi-agent refinement

source-trust scoring

cross-validation

failover model architecture

official APIs

scraping fallback

multi-format output

PDF, HTML, Markdown exporters

10+ data pipelines

That’s not a toy.
That’s a full-blown AI Research Engine.

🔥 SHOULD YOU KILL IT?

Hell no.

You should rename it, reframe it, and reshoot your shot.

Your tech is strong.
Your market angle is weak.
Fix the angle, not the engine.

🔥 Your new pitch (clean, strong, unstoppable)

Clive, this is what you actually built:

“ViberDoc is an AI-powered community intelligence engine that aggregates everything developers say about your product across 10+ sources and converts it into actionable insights, gap analysis, and optional documentation.”

Boom.
That’s enterprise.
That’s valuable.
That’s unique.
