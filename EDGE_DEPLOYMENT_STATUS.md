# Edge Deployment Implementation Status

**Created**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: Template Ready - Requires Setup

## Overview

Edge deployment configuration and code templates have been created for Cloudflare Workers and Vercel. These provide a production-ready starting point but require setup steps before deployment.

## What's Implemented

### ✅ Cloudflare Workers Template (`server/cloudflare-worker.ts`)

**Implemented Features**:
- Worker Sites integration for serving static assets
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Rate limiting via Durable Objects (optional)
- CORS support
- Cache control headers (1 year assets, 1 hour HTML)
- Proper Content-Type detection

**Code Quality**: Production-ready template

### ✅ Configuration Files

**`wrangler.toml`**:
- Worker Sites configuration (commented, ready to enable)
- Durable Object bindings for rate limiting
- Environment variable structure
- Deployment routes

**`EDGE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**:
- Comprehensive deployment instructions for Cloudflare and Vercel
- SSL automation guidance
- Cache configuration best practices
- Performance targets (TTFB < 200ms, cache hit ratio > 90%)
- Monitoring and rollback procedures

### ✅ Vercel Configuration

**`vercel.json`** (already exists):
- Security headers configured
- Routing rules set up
- Ready for deployment

## Setup Required Before Production Deployment

### For Cloudflare Workers

**Step 1: Enable Worker Sites**

Edit `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
# Uncomment these lines:
[site]
bucket = "./dist"
entry-point = "workers-site"
```

**Step 2: Build Assets**

```bash
npm run build
# Outputs to ./dist
```

**Step 3: Deploy**

```bash
# First time setup
wrangler login
npx wrangler types  # Generate types

# Deploy
wrangler deploy --env production
```

**Step 4 (Optional): Enable Durable Objects for Rate Limiting**

1. Uncomment Durable Object bindings in `wrangler.toml`
2. Deploy Durable Object class
3. Test rate limiting functionality

### For Vercel

**Already configured** - just run:
```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Testing the Deployment

### Local Testing (Wrangler Dev)

```bash
# Start local worker
wrangler dev

# Test asset serving
curl http://localhost:8787/assets/main.js

# Test HTML serving
curl http://localhost:8787/index.html
```

### Production Validation

```bash
# Test TTFB
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s https://your-worker.workers.dev

# Expected: time_starttransfer < 0.2s (200ms)
```

## Phase 1 Roadmap Alignment

From `PRODUCTION_HARDENING_ROADMAP.md` - Milestone 5.1 & 5.2:

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **M5.1: Edge Platform Deployment** | ✅ Template Ready | Requires wrangler.toml setup |
| **M5.2: SSL Automation** | ✅ Documented | Cloudflare/Vercel handle automatically |
| **M5.2: CDN Caching** | ✅ Implemented | Worker Sites provides global CDN |
| **M5.2: Cache-Busting** | ✅ Implemented | Vite generates hashed filenames |
| **Target: TTFB P95 < 200ms** | ⏳ Pending Testing | Achievable with edge caching |
| **Target: Cache HIT ratio > 90%** | ⏳ Pending Testing | Worker Sites should achieve this |

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Before First Deployment

- [ ] Uncomment Worker Sites config in `wrangler.toml`
- [ ] Set Cloudflare account_id in `wrangler.toml`
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to generate dist/ folder
- [ ] Test locally with `wrangler dev`
- [ ] Deploy to Cloudflare Workers: `wrangler deploy`
- [ ] Verify assets load correctly from edge
- [ ] Configure custom domain (docs.viberdoc.app)
- [ ] Test TTFB from multiple regions

### For Production Monitoring

- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Analytics
- [ ] Monitor cache hit ratio (target > 90%)
- [ ] Monitor TTFB P95 (target < 200ms)
- [ ] Configure alerts for 5xx errors
- [ ] Set up automated deployment via GitHub Actions

## Known Limitations

1. **Worker Sites Required**: The current implementation requires Worker Sites to be enabled. Without it, assets will 404.
2. **KV Alternative Not Implemented**: The code supports KV-based asset serving but no upload workflow exists yet.
3. **Durable Objects Optional**: Rate limiting works but requires additional setup.

## Alternative: Vercel Deployment

If you prefer simpler setup, use Vercel:

**Advantages**:
- Zero additional configuration needed
- `vercel.json` already configured
- Automatic SSL and CDN
- Preview deployments for PRs

**Command**:
```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Next Steps

Choose one path:

**Path A: Cloudflare Workers** (Best for maximum control)
1. Enable Worker Sites in wrangler.toml
2. Build and deploy
3. Validate performance metrics

**Path B: Vercel** (Best for simplicity)
1. Run `vercel deploy --prod`
2. Done!

Both paths meet Phase 1 requirements for edge deployment, SSL automation, and CDN caching.
