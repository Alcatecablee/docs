## 🔒 Security Verification

✅ **All credentials properly stored in Replit Secrets**  
✅ **No hardcoded credentials in source code**  
✅ **`.env` files protected by `.gitignore`**  
✅ **Environment variables loading correctly**

## 📊 Production Readiness

### ✅ Ready for Use
- All critical API services functional
- Database connected and operational
- Payment processing enabled
- AI documentation generation ready
- Search APIs operational

### ⚠️ Recommendations
1. **Monitor SerpAPI quota**: You have 187 searches left. Consider upgrading if needed.
2. **PayPal in Production Mode**: Double-check this is intentional. Use sandbox for testing.
3. **Optional**: Add Brave Search API as a cost-effective fallback to SerpAPI.
4. **Optional**: Configure Redis for production deployment (improves job queue persistence).
