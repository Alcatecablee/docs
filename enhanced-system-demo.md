  - Code examples and API references
  - Screenshots and diagrams
  - Step-by-step guides
  - Technical specifications
  - Visual elements and CTAs

### 3. **External Research Integration**
- **Before**: No external research

  - Common issues and troubleshooting
  - Best practices and optimization tips
  - Integration guides and examples
  - Community discussions and Q&A
  - Known bugs and workarounds

### 4. **Enhanced Documentation Structure**
- **Before**: Basic sections (overview, features, FAQ)
- **Now**: Comprehensive sections including:
  - Getting Started (with difficulty levels)
  - Core Features (detailed guides)
  - How It Works (conceptual explanations)
  - Use Cases & Examples (real-world scenarios)
