## Enhanced Prompt 1: Deep Site Discovery & Content Mapping

### Purpose

Discover all relevant pages, perform external research, and create a comprehensive content map using multiple data sources.

### Template

> **System Context**: You are an expert web researcher and documentation architect. Your goal is to create comprehensive, enterprise-grade documentation by exploring multiple sources and performing thorough research.
> 
> **Task**: Analyze the provided comprehensive data from multiple sources and create a complete content map.
> 
> **Phase 1: Site Discovery & Crawling**
> 
> **Instructions**:
> 1. **Analyze all discovered pages** to understand the complete product/service ecosystem
> 2. **Identify key documentation sections** from navigation, footer, and site structure:
>    - `/docs` or `/documentation`
>    - `/help` or `/support` or `/help-center`
>    - `/blog` or `/articles` (for use cases, tutorials, announcements)
>    - `/api` or `/api-docs` or `/developers`
>    - `/guides` or `/tutorials` or `/getting-started`
>    - `/faq` or `/questions`
>    - `/changelog` or `/updates` or `/releases`
